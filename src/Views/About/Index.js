                          <p>The FunGuys NFT project was created to bring fun, humor, 
                              and incredibly adorable artwork to the NFT space on the 
                              Cardano blockchain. Created by a team of 3 crypto, Cardano 
                              and NFT enthusiasts, we hope for this to be a project that our 
                              fellow NFT <span>enthusiasts</span> can get behind!  Not to mention, the 
                              passion behind mushrooms is large with this one. </p>
